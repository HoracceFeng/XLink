# XLink Project: A novel Scene Text Detector based on Segmentation Method 
**with PIXEL LINK as code base**

This repo is a re-implementation of [PixelLink source code](https://github.com/ZJULearning/pixel_link). Two reasons to use this code:
1. convenient to config and use smoothier
2. build up your own experiment environment for scene text detection research, especially for segmentation methods


## DONE
- Code Clean:
  - test_portable.py
  - evaluation scripts
  - remove `pylib` dependency


## TODO
- [ ] Reimplement PIXEL LINK
- [ ] Experiment Env
- [ ] Segmentation Methods and Tricks
